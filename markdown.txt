# 🎨 Vibe Project Generator

> A web tool that helps developers and creatives generate a visual design vibe for their project or brand, powered by natural language input.

## 🚀 Overview

The Vibe Project Generator helps users describe the kind of project or brand they’re building — and outputs aesthetic recommendations including **color palettes**, **styles**, **fonts**, and **images** to create a compelling design identity.

Ideal for solo devs, startups, hackathon teams, and anyone struggling with early-stage UI inspiration.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Many creators know *what* they want to build, but not *how it should look*. They struggle to translate project ideas into UI aesthetics. This tool bridges that gap by auto-generating design guidance based on plain English descriptions.
